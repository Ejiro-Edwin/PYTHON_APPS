# PYTHON_APPS
My PYTHON Learning Curve


Firstly, I Installed Python from www.python.org
Then...
I created a Virtual Enviroment using : Via the command Line


pip install virtualenv

pip install virtualenvwrapper

Then i navigated to my Desktop Directory using the windows command prompt in which i created my Helloworld folder Using:

mkdir Hello World

cd Hello World


Then i installed Flask Using : Via the command Line

pip install Flask

I checked to see all the dependencies that came with installing Flask Using :

pip freeze


I followed best practices by saving the dependencies into my requirement.txt file using :

pip freeze > requirements.txt


Then i wrote my Hello World App using a text editor in hello_world.py file :

Then i went back to my commandline interface to run the app using:

set FLASK_APP=hello_world.py

flask run
